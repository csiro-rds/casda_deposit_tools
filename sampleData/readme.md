# Sample Data

This folder contains small size sample ASKAP data only. Any files over 150KB should 
be located on a server and a note added here about the location.


## Continuum Source Detection Catalogues

Two continuum catalogues are presented, each in two formats (ASCII and XML/VOTable).

* components - individual bright points within the image
* islands - best guesses at actual objects within the image

The catalogues are generated by the [Duchamp](http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/Matthew.Whiting/Duchamp/) source finder.

We will be processing the XML/VOTable files but the ASCII ones are easier to read for human. The columns order is changed in Duchamp every now and again though!
